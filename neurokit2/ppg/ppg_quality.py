    """**PPG Signal Quality Assessment**

    Assess the quality of the PPG Signal using various methods:

    * The ``"templatematch"`` method (loosely based on Orphanidou et al., 2015) computes a continuous
      index of quality of the PPG signal, by calculating the correlation coefficient between each
      individual pulse wave and an average (template) pulse wave shape. This index is therefore
      relative: 1 corresponds to pulse waves that are closest to the average pulse wave shape (i.e.
      correlate exactly with it) and 0 corresponds to there being no correlation with the average
      pulse wave shape.

    * The ``"dissimilarity"`` method (loosely based on Sabeti et al., 2019) computes a continuous index
      of quality of the PPG signal, by calculating the level of dissimilarity between each individual
      pulse wave and an average (template) pulse wave shape (after they are normalised). A value of
      zero indicates no dissimilarity (i.e. equivalent pulse wave shapes), whereas values above or below
      indicate increasing dissimilarity. The original method used dynamic time-warping to align the pulse
      waves prior to calculating the level of dsimilarity, whereas this implementation does not currently
      include this step.

    * The ``"ho2025"`` method (Ho et al., 2025) assesses PPG quality on a beat-by-beat basis by predicting
      whether each interbeat-interval (IBI) is accurate. To do so, beats are detected using a primary beat detector,
      and each IBI is predicted to be accurate only if a secondary beat detector detects beats
      in the same positions (within a tolerance). In this implementation, all signal samples within an
      IBI are rated as high quality (1) if that IBI is predicted to be accurate, or low
      quality (0) if that IBI is predicted to be inaccurate. Ho et al. proposed this approach for the ECG, and here
      it has been applied to the PPG. The general approach was derived by Ho et al from the previously proposed bSQI
      approach.

    * The ``"skewness"`` method (based on Selveraj, 2011 and Elgendi, 2016) computes the skewness of the PPG signal.
      The skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of the signal's amplitude values.
      In Elgendi (2016), higher quality signals were generally found to have higher skewness values.

    * The ``"kurtosis"`` method (based on Selveraj, 2011 and Elgendi, 2016) computes the kurtosis of the PPG signal.
      The kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of the signal's amplitude values.
      In Elgendi (2016), higher quality signals were generally found to have higher kurtosis values.

    * The ``"entropy"`` method (based on Selvaraj et al., 2011, and inspired by Elgendi, 2016) computes the entropy of the
      signal in moving windows. The entropy is a measure of the randomness in the signal's amplitude values.

    * The ``"perfusion"`` method (based on Elgendi, 2016) computes the perfusion index of the PPG signal.
      The perfusion index is the ratio of the amplitude of the pulsatile (AC) component of the PPG to its baseline (DC)
      amplitude, expressed as a percentage. It is calculated over moving windows (default: 3 seconds window, 2 seconds
      overlap). Requires raw PPG signal.

    * The ``"relative_power"`` method (based on Elgendi, 2016) computes the relative power of the PPG signal.
      The relative power is the ratio of the power in the 1-2.25 Hz band to the power in the 0-8 Hz band, giving a value
      between 0 and 1. It is calculated over moving windows (default: 60 seconds window, 30 seconds overlap). Requires
      raw PPG signal.

        Number of bins for ``"entropy"`` calculation (default: 16).

    -------
    quality : array
        Vector containing the quality index ranging from 0 to 1 for ``"templatematch"`` method,
        or an unbounded value (where 0 indicates high quality) for ``"dissimilarity"`` method,

        or an unbounded value for ``"skewness"``, ``"kurtosis"``, or ``"entropy"``,
        or a value between 0 and 100% for ``"perfusion"`` method (100% being high quality),

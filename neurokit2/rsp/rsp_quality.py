    """**RSP Signal Quality Assessment**

    Assess the quality of the RSP Signal. using template matching:

    * The ``"templatematch"`` method (loosely based on Charlton et al., 2021) computes a continuous
      index of quality of the RSP signal, by calculating the correlation coefficient between each
      individual breath and an average (template) breath shape. This index is therefore
      relative: 1 corresponds to breaths that are closest to the average breath shape (i.e.
      correlate exactly with it) and 0 corresponds to there being no correlation with the average
      breath shape. Note that for pre-processing, Charlton et al. cleaned the signal with a low-pass filter
      below 1 Hz (the "charlton2021" method in rsp_clean), and used the "bettermann1996" breath detection
      algorithm (the "bettermann1996" method in rsp_peaks).

    * The ``"dissimilarity"`` method (borrowed from Sabeti et al., 2019, who proposed it for the PPG signal)
      computes a continuous index of quality of the RSP signal, by calculating the level of dissimilarity between
      each individual breath and an average (template) breath shape (after they are normalised). A value of
      zero indicates no dissimilarity (i.e. equivalent breath shapes), whereas values above or below
      indicate increasing dissimilarity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_cleaned : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The cleaned RSP signal in the form of a vector of values.
    peaks : tuple or list
        The list of RSP peak samples returned by ``rsp_peaks()``. If None, peaks is computed from
        the signal input.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The method for computing RSP signal quality. The only option is ``"templatematch"`` (default).

    Returns
    -------
    quality : array
        Vector containing the quality index ranging from 0 to 1.
